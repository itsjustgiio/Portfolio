## 🧠 About Me
Hi! I’m **Giovanni Carrion**, a Computer Science student at **The City College of New York (CCNY)**.

Some of my featured projects include:
- 🧘 **SereneScape Lite** — Mental wellness web app with Gemini AI–powered reflections and meditations  
- 🥗 **FareFit** — AI-powered nutrition tracker with Firebase + Gemini API integration
